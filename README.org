My custom build of DWM

** Patches:
   - *actualfullscreen* to toggle fullscreen
   - *alwayscenter*
   - *anybar* because I use polybar
   - *attachbottom* to make spawning a new window not distracting
   - *autostart* to not rely on xinitrc
   - *cyclelayouts* to cycle between layouts
   - *float-border-color* to give floats a different border color
   - *fullgaps* I love gaps :)
   - *gaplessgrid* seemed cool
   - *ipc* required by polybar-dwm-module
   - *restartsig* restart dwm with a key combination
   - *rotatestack* seemed usefull and I have no idea where it takes effect

** Deploying:
   Clone the repo and run:
   #+begin_src shell
	 sudo make install
   #+end_src
